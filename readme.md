HW03
===
This is the hw03 sample. Please follow the steps below.

# Build the Sample Program

1. Fork this repo to your own github account.

2. Clone the repo that you just forked.

3. Under the hw03 dir, use:

	* `make` to build.

	* `make clean` to clean the ouput files.

4. Extract `gnu-mcu-eclipse-qemu.zip` into hw03 dir. Under the path of hw03, start emulation with `make qemu`.

	See [Lecture 02 ─ Emulation with QEMU] for more details.

5. The sample is a minimal program for ARM Cortex-M4 devices, which enters `while(1);` after reset. Use gdb to get more details.

	See [ESEmbedded_HW02_Example] for knowing how to do the observation and how to use markdown for taking notes.

# Build Your Own Program

1. Edit main.c.

2. Make and run like the steps above.

3. Please avoid using hardware dependent C Standard library functions like `printf`, `malloc`, etc.

# HW03 Requirements

1. How do C functions pass and return parameters? Please describe the related standard used by the Application Binary Interface (ABI) for the ARM architecture.

2. Modify main.c to observe what you found.

3. You have to state how you designed the observation (code), and how you performed it.

	Just like how you did in HW02.

3. If there are any official data that define the rules, you can also use them as references.

4. Push your repo to your github. (Use .gitignore to exclude the output files like object files or executable files and the qemu bin folder)

## hw03
# 1.實驗題目
撰寫簡易c語言並觀察其組語、暫存器、記憶體的變化
# 2.實驗步驟
1.先將資料夾 gnu-mcu-eclipse-qemu 完整複製到 ESEmbedded_HW03 資料夾中
2.寫個c語言的簡單程式
3.make之後觀察其組語和使用make qemu觀察暫存器與記憶體的狀態
